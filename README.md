<h2>Working Tickets</h2>

<h3>Scenario #1:</h3> 
i. Intake - We begin by navigating to http://localhost/osTicket within our browser and submitting a ticket as our end user, Karen Gee.
Karen will be reporting that the entire online banking system is down.

<br />
<br />

Now, we login to our help desk environment as John Doe, one of our support agents and enter the Admin Panel. <br />
From here, we can see Karen has submitted a ticket.
<br />
<br />
ii. Assignment and Initial Outreach- Karen has indicated this is a <i>business critical outage</i>, which requires us to change the severity level to A, as per our service level agreement. We can also assign this particular ticket to Jane, who provides support to the online banking department.

<br />
<br />
iii. Working the ticket - Jane Doe then reaches out immediately to the customer reporting the outage and gathers more information. Jane deduces the issue is directly related to recent updates. She then takes the appropriate action, contacting the software vendor to report the issue and rescinding the update. 

iv. Resolution - This solved our <i>availability</i> issue and allowed Jane to close the ticket.
