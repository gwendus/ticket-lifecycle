<h2>Working Tickets</h2>

<h3>Scenario #1:</h3> 
i. Intake - We begin by navigating to http://localhost/osTicket within our browser and submitting a ticket as our end user, Karen Gee.
Karen will be reporting that the entire online banking system is down.

<br />
<br />

Now, we login to our help desk environment as John Doe, one of our support agents and enter the Admin Panel. <br />
From here, we can see Karen has submitted a ticket.
<br />
<br />
ii. Assignment and Initial Outreach- Karen has indicated this is a <i>business critical outage</i>, which requires us to change the severity level to A, as per our service level agreement. We can also assign this particular ticket to Jane, who provides support to the online banking department.
<br />

<br />
<br />
iii. Working the ticket - Jane Doe then reaches out immediately to the customer reporting the outage and gathers more information. Jane deduces the issue is directly related to recent updates. She then takes the appropriate action, contacting the software vendor to report the issue and rescinding the update. 

iv. Resolution - This solved our <i>availability</i> issue and allowed Jane to close the ticket.

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

John Doe will see from his admin panel that a ticket has been submitted by Ken <br />
<br />
<br />
ii. Assignment and Initial Outreach- Ken has not indicated the appropriate severity level. This is a <i>moderate impact outage</i>, which requires us to change the severity level to B, as per our service level agreement. We can also assign this particular ticket to John, who provides general IT support, including software updates.
<br />

<br />
<br />
iii. Working the ticket - John Doe then reaches out immediately to the customer reporting the outage and gathers more information. John makes internal notes to update the SLA to Sev-B for moderate impact upon learning the issue is only affecting 2 people within the department. A contingency plan is made with the customer to restart the program and relaunch it after lunch.

<br />

John Doe will see from his admin panel that a ticket has been submitted by Karen <br />
<br />
<br />
ii. Assignment and Initial Outreach- Karen has indicated the appropriate severity level, according to the information initially presented. This is a <i>moderate impact outage</i>, which requires us to change the severity level to B, as per our service level agreement. We can also assign this particular ticket to John, who provides general IT support, including hardware issues.

<br />
<br />
iii. Working the ticket - John Doe then reaches out to the customer. John has heard from Karen the CFO needs the laptop examined promptly for a meeting. With this in mind, John updates the priority level to "emergency," also making a note regarding possibly reclassifying the priority level depending on what he finds. Fortunately for him, upon examining the hardware, he discovers all that is needed is a new charger. The priority level is changed back to normal.
<br />
